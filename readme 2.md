# My Capstone

My Capstone project is called Data Legend. It's a project where I developed an interesting question, collected the data required to model that data, developed the best models for prediction, and communicate the findings to other data scientists and non-technical individuals. This introductory document lays out the project's parts.

## My Deliverables

- A decent predictive model using both structured and unstructured machine learning techniques, as well as clean, well written code. 
- A technical report aimed at fellow data scientists that explains my process and findings.
- A public presentation of my findings aimed at laypeople.

### **[The Main NoteBook](./part_01/)**

In this notebook, I gain insights of the data, cleaning it, understanding it,  applying some feature engineering to it, and getting a baseline accuracy.


### **[The players analysis notebook](./part_02/)**

In this notebook, I try to predict the success of a team of players depending on their champions.

### **[The champions bans notebook](./part_05/)**

In this notebook, I try to predict the success of a champion depending on the number of times they get banned*
*In a match, each team can pick 5 different champions and ban the other team from picking those champions.
